This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R programming related to handling missing values (NA) during calculations. The `bug.r` file contains the erroneous code which may produce incorrect results or throw unexpected errors if the input data contains missing values or non-numeric data within the 'values' column.  The `bugSolution.r` file provides a corrected version demonstrating best practices for handling missing data. This example highlights the importance of robust data validation and proper use of functions like `mean()` and `sd()` in R.
